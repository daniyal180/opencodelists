We record architecturally significant decisions in Architecture Decision
Records (ADRs). Refer to [this article by Michael
Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
for an introduction and guidelines.

ADRs are stored as markdown-format text files in this directory, each with a
leading 4-digit incrementing identifier and a meaningful name (e.g.,
`0001-record-name.md`).

Determining what is "architecturally significant" is subjective. Nygard defines it as
"decisions that affect the structure, non-functional characteristics,
dependencies, interfaces, or construction techniques". Examples include:

- Decisions about the overall purposes of the system and its interfaces with
  other elements of its ecosystem.
- Key technology, framework, and system design decisions.
- Decisions about how the code is deployed and managed in production.
- Decisions impacting scalability, security, or maintainability.
- Adopting a design pattern that influences multiple components.

Purely functional or business-logic decisions are unlikely to be architectural.

If the context, rationale, and consequences of a decision can be easily
documented in a single location and are still easily discoverable, it may be
preferable to avoid creating an ADR. Use ADRs when the decision has long-term
implications or needs greater visibility for future reference.

We do not plan to create retroactive ADRs as a separate activity. If an
investigation has been done into the rationale for past decisions, it may be
useful to document the findings in an ADR.
